I have been a computer and math geek since childhood, learning through curiosity and trial-and-error. Today, I am a machine learning researcher specializing in reinforcement learning, deep learning, and probabilistic modeling, with publications at top venues such as NeurIPS and ICLR. I am skilled in developing machine learning systems, collaborating across disciplines, and mentoring students. I am a versatile researcher who can quickly adapt to new domains in machine learning.
